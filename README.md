## About Me 
My name is Jacob Angel and I was born in Southwest Missouri in May of 2003. I first started programming about 2 years ago using Codecademy's JavaScript course. After learning JS the next thing I decided to pick up was Java. Java stuck with my like glue and ive been coding in it ever since I learned it in Codecademy. I had gotten bored of making console games and wanted to make games with graphics and thats when I learned about how you make games with Java. Ive been learning and going to school at Ozarks Technical Community College for Computer Science courses since my Junior year in highschool. I am now almost done with my first semester of my Senior year in high school and I decided I would upload some of these old projects to github so I could preserve them. Anyways the code is very bad but hey I at least I got something to run!

# The Games

- Gradiga
- Megaman Clone Beta
- Obamanious (ShooterGame)
- Snake2
- Solid Collisions (First Attempt at a RPG)
- StartStop (Pong)
- Tile Based Movement (Another Snake Game)
- TileRPG (Just some weird tile art thing)

## _Gradiga_

 A space shooter game where you move around the x-axis shooting blocks that fall from the sky. As you shoot more and more blocks, more blocks will spawn and they fall faster and faster.

I experimented with trying to make an animated background. There are a bunch of little dots that move around the background that are customizeable using the WASD Keys.

## _Megaman Clone Beta_

A very early stage project that I attempted to use 2D movement physics like gravity and velocity on the x-axis to move the charecter. Not much else to this one.

## _Obaminous_

This was a project that I somewhat finished. I used the movement from the Megaman clone and turned it into a space shooter game. You play as a spaceship that is being attacked by a bunch of Obama Rectangles. Everytime you clear out a wave of Obamas, a new wave starts and even more Obamas spawn. You keep going until you die and you get a score based on how many Obamas you kill.

## _Snake2_

One of my first ever Java Games that was made  by my 15 year old self. It's snake but without any self collision because I couldn't figure it out. To componsate for my lack of knowledge I made an enemy system where every single time you eat an apply an enemy appears and blocks your path. You have to manuever around the enemys and with more and more of them spawning thats where the difficulty of the game starts coming into play.

## _Solid Collisions (RPG Game)_

This was my first ever attempt to make a JRPG game that was supposed to be like the old Final Fantasy games on the NES consoles. It has a random encounter system, a shop system, a Inn system where you can sleep and recover HP. The encounter system uses turn based combat where you can Attack, Use Magic, Use Items, and flee from combat. You gain XP and gold for every battle you complete and you can level up if you gain enough HP. There was supposed to be a boss at the end after you found the key hidden in one of the various rooms. You would use the key to open a door and then after you would fight the boss. However I never completed that part of the game. This was also around the time when I started going to my local Community College at age 15 for Computer Science courses.

## _Start Stop (Pong)_

This project I believe was the second ever project I felt like I had finished. It's a terrible pong clone and there is no real collision besides the paddle collisions. I just hard-coded the values for the edges of the screen and when the ball hit those hard coded x and y values the ball would 'bounce' and change direction. You would play until one player reached a score of 10. After that, the game would take you to a game over screen and you could start another game from there.

## _Tlie Based Movement (Another Snake Game)_

This version of the snake game I created the a better way to detect for collision and with itself. I found a way to check for self collision and also with the edges of the screen. It's a real snake game this time but I ran into a pretty massive issue during this one that made me rethink how I would make games in the future. Framerate Dependancy. The snake would move at a speed that was determined how many fps the computer was getting. And for most computers that game would run very very fast. So i had to use V-Sync to lock the frames at a low amount so that it would be the same on all computers that could run it.

## _Tile RPG (It's not a Tile RPG)_

A very very old project thats not really even a game. All it does is create a window that draws a bunch of sqaures the screen to sets them to a certian color. The user can then use certain keys to change a specific layer of squares which will make the entire thing look different. I don't know where I was going with this one but it can look cool sometimes I guess.
